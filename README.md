A modern calendar application built with [libcosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic), featuring CalDAV support for seamless calendar synchronization.

## About

Sol is a native calendar application designed for the COSMIC desktop environment. Built using libcosmic's widget system, it provides a clean, intuitive interface inspired by Apple Calendar's design while following COSMIC's design language and responsive layout patterns.

The application will support CalDAV protocol for synchronizing events with calendar servers like Nextcloud, Radicale, and other standard CalDAV-compatible services.

## Current Status

This project is in **active development**. The UI foundation is in place, but core calendar functionality is still being implemented.

### ✅ Implemented Features

#### Core UI
- Apple Calendar-inspired layout with responsive left sidebar
- Mini calendar in sidebar for quick date navigation
- Day selection with visual feedback (outlined today, filled selection)
- Square day cells with 4px rounded corners (theme-independent)
- Instant responsive UI that adapts to window size
- Sidebar overlay mode for small screens (COSMIC Files-style)
- COSMIC-style menu bar (File, Edit, View)
- Navigation controls (Previous/Next/Today buttons)

#### Multiple View Modes
- **Month View**: Full month calendar grid with week numbers (optional)
- **Week View**: Week schedule with hourly time slots and all-day events section

- Week number calculation (ISO 8601)
- Multiple languages supported (English, German, French, Ukrainian)

#### Calendar Management

- [ ] Event notifications
- [ ] Recurring events
- [ ] Background sync
- [ ] Search functionality

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- libcosmic dependencies (automatically fetched from git)

### Compile

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Architecture

Sol follows the **Elm/MVU (Model-View-Update)** architecture pattern, which is standard for libcosmic applications:

### Key Architecture Patterns

- **MVU Pattern**: Clean separation of Model (state), View (rendering), and Update (state transitions)
- **Pure View Functions**: All views are pure functions that take state and return UI elements
- **Centralized State**: Single source of truth in `CosmicCalendar` struct
- **Message-Based Updates**: All state changes happen through message passing
- **Caching Layer**: `CalendarCache` pre-computes calendar states for performance
- **Calendar Abstraction**: `CalendarSource` trait enables pluggable calendar backends

## Technology Stack

- **[libcosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic)**: Modern UI framework for COSMIC desktop built on iced
- **chrono**: Date and time handling with timezone support
- **chrono-tz**: Timezone database
- **i18n-embed**: Internationalization framework
- **fluent**: Localization system (Mozilla Fluent)
- **icalendar**: iCalendar format parsing and generation
- **reqwest**: HTTP client for CalDAV operations
- **serde**: Serialization/deserialization
- **dirs**: Platform-specific directory handling
- **ron**: Rusty Object Notation for settings storage

## Planned CalDAV Support

The application will support full CalDAV protocol integration:

- Connect to any CalDAV-compatible server (Nextcloud, Radicale, etc.)
- Synchronize events bidirectionally
- Local event caching for offline access
- Support for multiple calendar accounts

### Planned CalDAV Configuration

Users will be able to configure:
1. CalDAV server URL
2. Username and password/app-specific password
3. Which calendars to sync
4. Sync interval

## Design Philosophy

- **Native COSMIC integration**: Uses libcosmic for native look and feel
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different window sizes with instant transitions
- **Theme-independent styling**: Critical UI elements maintain consistent appearance
- **Offline-first**: Local storage with server sync
- **Privacy-focused**: Events stored locally by default

## Recent Improvements

### Architecture Refactoring (Latest)
- **Centralized keyboard shortcuts**: Single source of truth in `keyboard.rs`, eliminating duplication
- **Split UI constants**: Separated `layout_constants.rs` and `color_constants.rs` for better organization
- **Calendar initialization**: Moved default calendar creation to `CalendarManager::with_defaults()`
- **Improved maintainability**: Better separation of concerns and single responsibility principle

### Year View Implementation
- Apple Calendar-inspired 12-month grid layout (3×4)
- Today highlighting with accent color
- Localized month names
- Proper vertical scaling for consistent month sizes
- Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+4`
