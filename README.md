A modern calendar application built with [libcosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic), featuring CalDAV support for seamless calendar synchronization.

## About

Sol is a native calendar application designed for the COSMIC desktop environment. Built using libcosmic's widget system, it provides a clean, intuitive interface inspired by other popular Calendar's design while following COSMIC's design language and responsive layout patterns.

The application will support CalDAV protocol for synchronizing events with calendar servers like Nextcloud, Radicale, and other standard CalDAV-compatible services.

## Current Status

This project is in **active development**. The UI foundation is in place, but core calendar functionality is still being implemented.

- Sidebar overlay mode for small screens (COSMIC Files-style)
- COSMIC-style menu bar (File, Edit, View)
- Navigation controls (Previous/Next/Today buttons)

#### Multiple View Modes
- **Month View**: Full month calendar grid with week numbers (optional)
  - Quick event creation by clicking on day cells
  - Multi-day event selection via drag

### Key Architecture Patterns

- **MVU Pattern**: Clean separation of Model (state), View (rendering), and Update (state transitions)
- **Pure View Functions**: All views are pure functions that take state and return UI elements
- **Centralized State**: Single source of truth in `CosmicCalendar` struct
- **Message-Based Updates**: All state changes happen through message passing
- **Caching Layer**: `CalendarCache` pre-computes calendar states for performance
- **Calendar Abstraction**: `CalendarSource` trait enables pluggable calendar backends

## Technology Stack

- **[libcosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic)**: Modern UI framework for COSMIC desktop built on iced
- **chrono**: Date and time handling with timezone support
- **chrono-tz**: Timezone database
- **i18n-embed**: Internationalization framework
- **fluent**: Localization system (Mozilla Fluent)
- **icalendar**: iCalendar format parsing and generation
- **reqwest**: HTTP client for CalDAV operations
- **serde**: Serialization/deserialization
- **dirs**: Platform-specific directory handling
- **ron**: Rusty Object Notation for settings storage

## Planned CalDAV Support

The application will support full CalDAV protocol integration:

- Connect to any CalDAV-compatible server (Nextcloud, Radicale, etc.)
- Synchronize events bidirectionally
- Local event caching for offline access
- Support for multiple calendar accounts

### Planned CalDAV Configuration

Users will be able to configure:
1. CalDAV server URL
2. Username and password/app-specific password
3. Which calendars to sync
4. Sync interval

## Design Philosophy

- **Native COSMIC integration**: Uses libcosmic for native look and feel
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different window sizes with instant transitions
- **Theme-independent styling**: Critical UI elements maintain consistent appearance
- **Offline-first**: Local storage with server sync
- **Privacy-focused**: Events stored locally by default

## Recent Improvements

### Week View Polish (Latest)
- **Current time indicator**: Red line spanning all days with dot on today's column
- **Auto-scroll**: Week view automatically scrolls to current time on entry
- **Timer updates**: Time indicator updates every 30 seconds
- **Overlapping events**: Side-by-side layout for concurrent events
- **Time-slot selection**: Drag to select time range for new timed events
- **Event drag-and-drop**: Reschedule events by dragging to new dates

### Event Management
- **Quick event creation**: Click day cell or use keyboard shortcut
- **Event dialog**: Full-featured editor with title, location, times, calendar selection
- **Database persistence**: SQLite storage with automatic schema creation
- **Event chips**: Color-coded display in month and week views

### Architecture Improvements
- **Modular update handlers**: Split `update.rs` into domain-specific modules
- **Dialog management**: Centralized dialog state in `dialogs/manager.rs`
- **Service layer**: Business logic separated into `services/` directory
- **Selection state**: Unified drag selection for dates and time slots
